Software for merging two images into one panoramic image

This software was written by Raz Mor and Noam Guetta

In order to run, you need to write the following command in CMD:
'python panorama.py "left_image_path" "right_image_path" "output_dir" '

left_image_path -> is the path to the left image
right_image_path -> is the path to the right image
output_dir -> is the directory location path of the panoramic output image

The edited image will be saved under the name '<left_image_name>+<right_image_name>_panoramic.jpg'

Enjoy :)
